A commonplace book is composed with a long timeline of articulating, organizing, and revisiting thoughts, and many handwritten commonplace books include an index that facilitates returning to earlier work based on identified themes. This workshop will help participants reflect on the purposes of intellectual preparation and process writing in the humanities and social sciences so they can make more conscious choices about digital note-taking for reading, listening, and composing purposes. It includes suggestions for how to set up the submission and evaluation of note-taking assignments on learning management systems such as Canvas and discusses sustainable evaluation and grading practices for reflective assignments. We will consider how note-taking assignments can create more inclusive and fair conditions for participation in class, especially in online classrooms. This workshop will also include images of historical commonplace books from the special collections of Houghton Library at Harvard University."}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/1AiBjC9YapNJEHgHpqXvNOOVOZO_5h-KDaJQEmtz3jzI/1/public/full/R18C9"},"updated":{"$t":"2021-07-16T16:53:09.590Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#cell"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"I18"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"Khristina H.

Scripto is the underlying architecture for the community transcription aspect of [The Papers of the War Department 1784-1800 (PWD)](https://wardepartmentpapers.org/), a digital humanities project which started at East Stroudsburg University in the mid 1990s. \nThe workshop will include an opportunity for participants to experiment with using Scripto for Omeka S as users and to experience its administrative interface. There will also be a guided discussion of the practicalities of sustaining digital humanities projects as they evolve to meet new needs, technologies, and audiences. The conversation will also include the practical concerns which arise when creating, and changing, a community-sourced project. We will address the need to recognize and celebrate the communities which are connected to the original materials and those who are doing the work of creating these transcriptions/translations. \nThe workshop leaders have experience with community-sourced projects through their work on Scripto and the PWD. Megan Brett is a doctoral candidate in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University and is currently the project manager for Scripto and the PWD. Dr. Christopher Hamner is the principal investigator for Scripto and is the Editor in Chief of the PWD."},"link":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/1AiBjC9YapNJEHgHpqXvNOOVOZO_5h-KDaJQEmtz3jzI/1/public/full/R20C8"}],"gs$cell":{"row":"20","col":"8","inputValue":"This workshop will use a hands-on experience with the open-source software [Scripto for Omeka S](https://www.scripto.org) to frame a conversation about building and sustaining community-sourced projects.

of us feel we are suffering from information overload, and through the use of the Distant Reader, this hands-on workshop facilitates activities to read large amounts of text. The Distant Reader is a tool for reading. It takes an arbitrary amount of text as input, does text mining and natural language processing against it, and outputs sets of structured data for in-depth analysis -- \"reading\". Intended for academics -- students, researchers, or scholars -- the Reader can consume and report on the whole of an undergraduate's reading list, the literature review of a researcher, or the totality of a genre for the humanist. The Distant Reader can literally consume, process, and report on hundreds, if not thousands, of journal articles or books. The Reader's output is affectionately called a \"study carrel\". It includes the original input data, the data transformed into plain text, a couple of narrative reports, many tab-delimited files, and a database file. Used in conjunction with either desktop and command-line tools, these files enable you to quickly and easily answer questions about your corpus. Example questions include: what is discussed in this corpus, how are things described, who is in the corpus, what places are mentioned, what are the overarching themes of the corpus, how are those themes related each other, which documents are exemplars, etc. Study carrels perform far beyond full text relevancy ranked indexing. In this workshop participants will be asked to assemble a small collection of PDF files, about a dozen items. Participants will compress the files into a single zip file, and submit the zip file to the Reader. The Reader will do its work and create a study carrel.

This radical approach to teaching literature leads to radical student work that is student-led and community-engaged.","$t":"This presentation will detail a grant-funded project intended to thoughtfully and ethically integrate Extended Reality (XR) technology across the curriculum. Born out of this project is a first-year literature course, certified as fulfilling “Intercultural Knowledge Competency” (IKC), focused on literature written by and about those seeking citizenship in the United States. The students in the course consider poetry, short stories, novels, and cultural objects such as music videos, viral content, and news publications as well as Virtual Reality applications that raise questions about the language and imagery used to define immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.Using narrative as a means of cultivating empathy, and service learning partnerships to encourage long-term action, this course employs what Lisa Blankenship coined “rhetorical empathy” to structure research and reflection. The introduction and critique of the VR applications is intended to test the hypothesis that immersive experiences can teach empathy, a premise currently under debate in both the humanities and social sciences.

Hughes's works, in the public domain since 2017, provide a wonderful resource for students learning textual curation.

Before they learned about the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), the students were assigned to define their own rules for encoding marks on facsimile page surfaces, and the handwriting inserted in typescript poems. In the second half of the course, as students learned HTML, XPath, and XSLT (used for transforming XML to other formats like HTML), they were assigned to develop small-scale digital editions hosted on GitHub from a set of options selected by Dr. Beshero-Bondar ([see https://newtfire.org/courses/textEncoding/projectOptions-2020.html](https://newtfire.org/courses/textEncoding/projectOptions-2020.html)).

From the start of the fall 2020 Text Encoding class at Penn State Erie, the class worked with digital facsimiles of Hughes's short manuscripts to experiment with encoding text structures and metadata in their first experience with eXtensible Markup Languages (XML). Before they learned about the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), the students were assigned to define their own rules for encoding marks on facsimile page surfaces, and the handwriting inserted in typescript poems. In the second half of the course, as students learned HTML, XPath, and XSLT (used for transforming XML to other formats like HTML), they were assigned to develop small-scale digital editions hosted on GitHub from a set of options selected by Dr. Beshero-Bondar ([see https://newtfire.org/courses/textEncoding/projectOptions-2020.html](https://newtfire.org/courses/textEncoding/projectOptions-2020.html)). Especially since we were away from campus archives during the pandemic, we needed legible online facsimiles as an \"on-ramp\" for students without much experience with reading cursive handwriting.

For example, Borgia prepared XSLT to feature each historical character in a searchable sorted index together with their longest speeches: https://am0eba-byte.github.io/BallotandMe/analysis.html. For this talk, Beshero-Bondar will discuss how she developed the project assignment, and Borgia will address the intellectual process of designing her own project.

The project, viewable at [https://alicer98.github.io/DIGIT-110-AJC-Survey/AJC-output.html](https://alicer98.github.io/DIGIT-110-AJC-Survey/AJC-output.html), contributes a significant new approach to modeling the document structures of primary sources that enmesh print with handwriting, with both equivalently important. Our collaboration highlights the importance of digital scholarly editing for Black digital humanities research that involves undergraduates with faculty scholars in making resources legible and findable."}},{"id":{"$t":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/1AiBjC9YapNJEHgHpqXvNOOVOZO_5h-KDaJQEmtz3jzI/1/public/full/R37C9"},"updated":{"$t":"2021-07-16T16:53:09.590Z"},"category":[{"scheme":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006","term":"http://schemas.google.com/spreadsheets/2006#cell"}],"title":{"type":"text","$t":"I37"},"content":{"type":"text","$t":"Elisa

2019, the Lehigh University Libraries Special Collections received a donation from the Bethlehem Police Department of over 700 police record books dating from 1916 to 1952. Since receipt of this collection, Special Collections work-study student assistants have been engaged in the processing, digitization, and transcription of these records. Under the supervision of Lehigh’s Digital Archivist, student assistants have digitized over fifty volumes of historical police records since August 2020. With Lehigh’s transition to virtual instruction in March 2020, transcription of these volumes has been a crucial part of students’ remote work. Using Google Drive, eight students have transcribed over 30 volumes and made thousands of arrest records readable and searchable in spreadsheets. Work-study students have also been working to normalize data contained within these records in order to produce a visualization using GIS software. Students will also assist in the creation of descriptive metadata to facilitate the ingestion of digitized police records into Lehigh’s Digital Collections repository, where they will be made accessible to the public. These records have also been used for primary source instruction in the course “History 090: Prisons and Policing in Modern U.S. History,” taught by Dr. Emily Pope-Obeda. This virtual instruction session used the police records to elucidate the history that led to the contemporary system of policing in America. In particular, this class session focused on representations of race, mental illness, and public health documented in these records and how the criminalization of certain activities has changed over time. This panel will consist of Digital Archivist Alex Japha, Assistant Professor of History Dr. Emily Pope-Obeda, and a Special Collections work study student. The panel will address the technical and ethical challenges of collecting, preserving, and making accessible historical police records along with the potential for research and teaching opportunities in this genre."},"link":[{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/1AiBjC9YapNJEHgHpqXvNOOVOZO_5h-KDaJQEmtz3jzI/1/public/full/R48C8"}],"gs$cell":{"row":"48","col":"8","inputValue":"In 2019, the Lehigh University Libraries Special Collections received a donation from the Bethlehem Police Department of over 700 police record books dating from 1916 to 1952.

However, after several hundred preliminary experiments, some pre-existing stylometric software has shown potential to be an accurate tool for doing authorship attribution in Khmer and related languages. Using the Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program, or JGAAP (Juola 2009), we compared 200 Khmer documents across 20 unique authors. While we observed marginal success across many different settings, the N-grams setting (Juola 2006) had the highest accuracy rate by far. While presenting our findings, we will also explore the nature of written Khmer to explain why this particular setting is so successful.

This field has many practical applications, from historical literature to forensic linguistics. Over the past few decades, a huge amount of work has been done regarding authorship attribution for commonly-spoken languages such as English, Spanish, Mandarin, etc. Unfortunately, the potential for authorship attribution in less-commonly spoken languages, such as those in Southeast Asia, has gone unrealized. \nA member of the Austroasiatic language family, Khmer is spoken by 18 million people, most of which are Cambodian (Ebenhard et al. 2021). Despite this sizable speaker base and rich literary history, no significant advances have yet been made for Khmer stylometry. This is partially because many authorship attribution techniques (and those of quantitative authorship attribution in particular) were specifically designed for English and other commonly-spoken languages. However, after several hundred preliminary experiments, some pre-existing stylometric software has shown potential to be an accurate tool for doing authorship attribution in Khmer and related languages. Using the Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program, or JGAAP (Juola 2009), we compared 200 Khmer documents across 20 unique authors. While we observed marginal success across many different settings, the N-grams setting (Juola 2006) had the highest accuracy rate by far. While presenting our findings, we will also explore the nature of written Khmer to explain why this particular setting is so successful. Finally, we will conclude with some discussion on the relevance of this work and potential for further studies in the future. \nEberhard, David M., Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2021.

this presentation, we will share our critical assessment of the process of appraising email for the creation of digital archives. As the Council on Library and Information Resources’ recent report on email archiving highlights (footnote), email has increasingly become an essential part of the historical record, yet it presents a series of unique challenges for preservation. Our work originates from a year-long class project dedicated to assisting A\u0026SC with the development of workflows for email archiving. Building on our experiences with the Department of Archives \u0026 Special Collections (A\u0026SC) at the University of Pittsburgh and on interviews with several digital archivists, we will review the different aspects involved in preparing for email preservation at a research university. In particular, we will discuss the privacy and legal concerns raised by email archiving and examine the process of appraisal through ePADD.
