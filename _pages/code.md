We work to make the Keystone DH Conference to be a welcoming, supportive, and comfortable environment  for all participants.. 
We encourage the following supportive behaviors:

+ Use welcoming language that honors pronoun preferences and favors - gender-neutral collective nouns
+ Encourage and yield the floor to those whose viewpoints may be under-represented in a group
+ Seek concrete ways to make physical spaces and online resources more universally accessible
+ Accept critique graciously and offer it constructively
+ Give credit where it is due

We will not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, country of origin, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, religion, veteran status or other protected class status; discriminatory or offensive images in public spaces; intimidation; stalking; harassing or unwanted photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants violating the code of conduct may be warned or asked to leave by conference organizers.

### Recording/Social Media Policy

We see the conference as a place to share information, not only with other participants, but also with those who may not be able to attend. Sessions are, by default, considered open and can be written about on social media and photographed. Each session can decide to adopt different rules at the beginning of the session as long as it informs all participants who join the session.

We are using Zoom as a platform for KeystoneDH2021. Zoomâ€™s privacy and security statements and information about removing your data from each of them are available on their website. [Visit Zoom's Privacy Statement for more information.](https://zoom.us/privacy)

We see the conference as a place to share information, not only with other participants, but also with those who may not be able to attend. Conference sessions will be handled as Meetings, which allow participants to join on-screen and participate beyond the chat function using video and audio functionality. All live sessions will be recorded and will be made available to attendees following the conference. Recorded Zoom sessions will capture how your name is displayed; chat information; and your profile picture, video feed, and microphone feed if you used it. If you are concerned about privacy, consider the name you use, the profile pic you select, and whether or not you want to use a virtual background if participating with video turned on. Sessions are, by default, considered open and can be written about on social media. However, do not record or screenshot any session without notification or consent from the presenter.

To contact the conference organizers about any concern, please email contactkeystonedh@gmail.com. During the conference, our Slack channel is another way to reach us.
