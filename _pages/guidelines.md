## Presenter Guidelines

For Keystone DH 2021, events will take place in a series of virtual formats.

Presentations may take the form of short papers, panel discussions or roundtables, workshops, poster sessions, or showcase demonstrations. 

### General Guidelines

All presentation sessions are 1.25 hours long. Panels, roundtables, and workshops will take place on Zoom. The Keystone Organizational Committee will set up Zoom meetings for each session, with presenters assigned as co-hosts. Technical hosts and moderators will be available to facilitate each session. 

Please keep in mind that presentations and documents are expected to meet [accessibility guidelines](https://wiki.diglib.org/Creating_Accessible_and_Interactive_Online_Presentations). In addition, presenters and attendees must agree to follow the conferenceâ€™s [Code of Conduct](https://keystonedh.network/2021/code).

### Presentation Format Guidelines

#### Panels/Short Papers

Papers will be allotted 15 minutes, while all discussions will take place over 1.25 hours. Approximately 15-20 minutes will be reserved for Live Q&A. 

Paper presenter can choose to pre-record their presentations. The organizers' preference is for presentations to be live. 

#### Roundtables 

The Roundtable format is a informal, open discussion format rather than a panel or lecture or poster format. The moderator should identify the key topics the roundtable is to address, then develop thought-provoking, open-ended questions to get at and discuss the issues surrounding these topics. Roundtables are also welcome to involve the audience in the discussion.

#### Workshops

Workshop presentations are expected to be live. Please coordinate with the organizers of the conference with any specific technical requests or issues with your workshop. Check out this guide for [remote workshop strategies](https://www.method.com/insights/field-guide-to-remote-workshops/). 

#### Digital Showcase

The Digital Showcase is tentatively planned to take place live on Zoom using breakout rooms. Showcase presenters are expected to prepare a five minute presentation. They are welcome to pre-record their presentation and show it for visitors to their virtual booth. Alternatively presenters can do a normal Poster Presentation live as guests visit their station and look at their work.
