We are excited to announce that 2022’s Keystone DH Conference will be held June 15-17 at Johns Hopkins University’s [Center for Digital Humanities](https://cdh.jhu.edu) in Baltimore, MD. Keystone DH is an annual conference and a network of institutions and practitioners committed to advancing collaborative scholarship in digital humanities research and pedagogy across the Mid-Atlantic. It is the organizers’ hope that the event will be hybrid, with both online and in-person components.

Proposals are welcome on any aspect of digital technologies and their application to the humanities and/or social sciences. We highly encourage projects that focus on the collaborative nature of research and teaching. Senior scholars should foreground the labor of students, librarians, and/or the community that sustained the project. We especially welcome proposals with representative and inclusive speaker involvement, and that highlight methods and insights that generalize beyond the immediate application described.

Presentations may take the form of short papers, panel discussions or roundtables, workshops, poster sessions, or showcase demonstration. All panels and workshops will take place over 1.5 hours, unless otherwise requested. If you are interested in running a longer hackathon, please email contact@keystonedh.network. The conference will include allotted times for a poster session and showcase demonstrations. Please keep in mind that presentations and documents will be expected to meet accessibility guidelines.

In the linked [Google Form](https://forms.gle/kuyd2gtDXBvZqqRHA), please submit your name, email address, title, and type of your proposed presentation, as well as a proposal of 200-300 words. The proposal deadline is February 1, 2022, and proposers will be notified by early March 2022.

If an in-person component of the conference is possible, we will be offering need-based stipends to support those presenting at the conference.
